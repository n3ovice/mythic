  - 20 There was a recent report sworn to by the entire crew of **The Whiskey Fish** (A sea slug troller-boat) about a meeting with a strange half-starved beautiful woman who was floundering on some floating frozen drift wood.  The woman was hauled aboard and given [Spicey Green Pepper Tea](#burnshire).  After her tea she requested food.  The sailors obliged and fed her some of their hard-tack.  After eating half a crate, she asked to open another.  The woman sat and ate voraciously for over an hour.  Then asked for some of their sea-slug catch.  The amazed fishermen obliged again and led her to the store-hold.  After another hour of non-stop eating, the captain tried to put a stop to it.  The woman cackled maniaclly then transformed in front of them into a large brown-golden dragon and swallowed the rest of their stores in a single gulp before bursting out of the hold and flying back towards the shore.

### The Kingdom

Everything on the map is under the rule of the King or Queen.  There are certainly parts of the world in which the [The Royal Family](#the-royal-family) has no power but that is only because the lands are untamed.  If the dwarfs ever reclaimed their throne keep in the [Druuthenhold Mountains](#druuthenholm-mountains), they may have some claim to sovereignty.  It is only because no one knows exactly where [Vanima](#vanima) is; that the elves escape any authority.  Wherever human civilization can be found, the royal decree is supreme.

- Knowledge Check
  - 5 [Blackstone](#blackstone) is in the east, [Lutra](#lutra) is in the north and [Castle Heron](#castle-heron) is in the south

  - 18 [Raz-Modian](#raz-modian) did indeed take all the gold and treasure from **Druuthenholm Keep** but before he could do the same to the second largest fortress in the mountains, _Braydr_, the Jarl of Braydr used his magic hammer to smelt the the city's treasure vault and in one strike, forged all the gold into a single ingot.  Before **Braydr** was torched, the **Braydr Ingot** escaped the city.

### Lutra

The lands that makeup [Lord Lutra's](#lord-lutra) region are known as _The Highlands_ or simply _Lutra_.  It is reasonably farm-able and very large.  The lands are known to produce more wheat then all the other territories combined.  It is also famous for it's livestock.  The horses, cows, pigs and even the chickens all seem to be extra alert, trainable, healthy and intelligent.

- Knowledge Check
  - 5 The lands of Lutra used to be choked with forest every bit as dense as [Mirwood](#the-grand-forest)
  - 10 Even though the peoples of Lutra are generally tall and broad, they **must** have some elven in them by the way they treat the land.  Even the name _Lutra_ sounds _elven_
  - 12 The forests were cleared out of _The Highlands_ hundreds of years ago, but the stone monuments that were formally deep in the woods are now scattered about randomly on old farms and fields.  They're locallay called **faerie stones**
  - 20 [The Kongalee Library](#university-of-lutra) will pay a fortune for documentation of any **new** faerie stones found in **Lutra**

## Cities and Towns

### Vanima

Thought to be a vast and mature elven citadel hidden somewhere in the [Northern Sea](#northern-sea).  Most of the elves wandering [The Kingdom](#the-kingdom) either don't know or choose not to divulge any confirmation of **Vanima**'s existence.  Their silence does nothing to combat the many rumors about Vanima and [The Elves](#the-elves).  Unlike the other races, Elves don't seem to collect together in single neighborhoods or regions.  While it isn't rare for a village to have the odd elf or two, it **is** very rare to see an elven family or even a large group.

- Knowledge Check
  - 10 The real location of Vanima is lost, even to the [elves](#the-elves) but it must be somewhere on the coast of _the Northern Sea_, deep in [the Grand Forest](#grand-forest).
  - 14 The strange white-gold elven coin that can sometimes be found in [Lutra](#lutra) and [the capital](#blackstone) must be from Vanima.
  - 18 Elves are mysterious as they are, but **especially strange** wood elves are traveling through the kingdom constantly.  They **must** know where Vanima is.

### Chendrin Hall

**Chendrin Hall** is the formal name of the huge barracks and fort that marks the edge of the frontier in the **south**.  It isn't technically affiliated with any particular noble house and takes soldiers from across the Kingdom.  Elves, Dwarfs and even _Halflings_ are among the ranks that are stationed at Chendrin.

The fort is responsable for the protection of all the villages and regions in the south and as such, it's soldiers see more action than anyone else in the kingdom.  [The less civil orcish warbands](#the-kimbree) consider themselves at constant war with [The Kingdom](#the-kingdom) and regularly muster offensives against Chendrin Hall.

- Knowledge Check
  - 14 Chendrin Hall will pay **100 Gold Coins** to any able bodies man or woman who enlists there.
  - 15 The 100 Coins will only be paid after **four years** of uninterrupted service..

### Castle Heron

The **3rd** largest city in the *The Kingdom*, ruled over by the most
powerful noble house other than the royal family themselves; [House
Heron](#house-heron).  **Castle Heron** itself is made of smooth polished stone.  It is likely the cleanest city in the Kingdom and is certainly the most well kept.  The dark purple banners of the Heron house add to the aesthetic as do the intricate capes, arms and armor that is furnished for the cities guard and officials.

### Burn Shire

Formerly a Beautiful farming community looked after by a noble lord.
When the lord's daughter was selected by [*Raz-Modian*](#raz-modian), he decided to
gather his knights and try to slay the dragon instead of paying tribute.
After Raz-Modian killed him and his men, he burned the village to
cinders and it never fully recovered. It is now called burn shire and is
known for it's very **spicy dried green peppers**.

  - Consuming a few will ignite a day of hot sweat and fever after which the victim will be cured of any common sicknesses and infections.

Blackstone is the capital of the kingdom, it is the largest city and
boasts the oldest history and most attractions. It is oddly named, as no
part of the city is made from anything that could be considered black
stone.

- Jingwei Basilica
  - Jingwei Basilica is a massive and Beautiful church of *Sol*. It has over a hundred chambers, no including *Catacombs* that are on the rear grounds.

### Bondwafer

Bondwafer is the largest and only Halfling town in *The Kingdom*. It has
a population of some odd 10,000 hobbits dispersed over a large region.
Most halflings live amongst the other races and it is often said that
there are more halflings in [*Blackstone*](#blackstone) than are in Bondwafer.  [Goodly Grue](#goodly-grue) calls bondwafer his home.

## Lords and Ladies

### The Queen

The queen is considered by most to be cold and condescending. Taking
little interest in her individual citizens and focusing more on the
power plays of the elite. She is known for preferring simple but often
radical solutions to petty problems like starvation and conflicts of
inheritance. In recent memory of the peasantry; she sent a legion of the
guard to the farmlands of

### Count Putnam Laplass

### Princess Eubuli

### High Priest Anslem

### Lord Bellingham

Formally a great hero knight, **Bellingham** can now be found pattering around his little house in [Blackstone](#blackstone).  Those who knew him in his prime, remember him as a fearless and barrel chested warrior with a quick temper.  Long after he had already retired, he abruptly sold all his lands and released all his servents to live out the rest of his days tending to his small home alone.  Those who see him now aren't likely to recognize him for what he was but rather as he seems; a bent old man with a growly voice and twinkling bright hazel eyes.

- Knowledge Check
  - 12 **Lord Bellingham** happily fathered a bastard son and raised him to be a fine young man.  The son fell in love with a good-hearted farmer's daughter and was to be wed.  Lord Bellingham loved his daughter-in-law-to-be as his own and was excited to see the two lovers into their own lands.  The girl caught the attention of [The Draco Cultists](#the-draco-cults) and was taken from their home in the dead of night and her fiancé was killed.  That was **22** years past and **Lord Bellingham** has never been the same.  Secretly swearing slow revenge on [Raz-Modian](#raz-modian) and all who follow him.

### Lady Jarvesetee

The last and only heir to the [Jarvesetee house](#house-jarvesetee).

  - 12 Gorm the Old survived the fight with **Raz-Modian** and fled the city
  - 18 Gorm the Old **definitely** died in the battle for **Druuthenhold**

### Lord Lutra

Sometimes called _The Dirt King_ or _Lord Buttered Bread_, **Lord Lutra** looks after the largest singular swath of land inside [The Kingdom](#the-kingdom).  His lands are famous for farming and animal husbandry.  His people are not rich or considered very fashionable but are generally content.  **Lord Lutra** himself is a massive fat man who delights in little pleasures, jokes and theater.  He seems to genuinely love his people.

### Goodly Grue

Goodly is an old and crazy **Gnome** who lives in a large patch of woods near [Bondwafer](#bondwafer). He is one of the only creatures who believes himself to be a gnome. He also has no real idea where the other gnomes live. He is a tinkerer, inventor and alchemist who is currently most interested in *The yellow mold* that grows near his cottage and in various other places. He is an excellent gardener and potion brewer.

## Factions and Guilds

### Royal Family

The current royal family is *The Laplass Family*.

### House Jarvesetee

Jarvesetee lands are considered to be the finest, albeit the smallest in the land, with a utilitarian and
productive people. A famous phrase from all over the kingdom is a
"Jarvesetee Beggar" which means, a person who is sad about something
small even though their life is generally alright.

### The Church

The only sanctioned religion in *The Kingdom*. Every city, town and even
most hamlets have at least a shrine dedicated to *Sol* and under the
direct control and curating of **The Church**. The church welcomes all
to it's services but within it's own branches, has a rigid structure and
hierarchy. Towns that are graced with a presence of the church have at
least a priest, priestess or friar. Some cities might have hundreds of
clergy. **The Church** doesn't directly involve itself in the day to day
political functions of *The Kingdom* but does have a single vote when it
comes time to *choose a royal house*. Wise noble houses would do well to
stay in the good graces of the church, since they command huge amounts
of public and private opinion. The church also provides communities with
vital medical and disaster relief services. They generally preach peace
and forgiveness but when they *have reason* they have little trouble
finding a passage or two in *The Prayers* to excuse violent torture.

### The Draco-Cults

There is only one Draco-Cult that moves through the kingdom in broad
daylight, that is the cult of *Raz-Modian*. Every year, the agents of
the red dragon select a maiden from amongst the citizenry and bring her
back to Raz-Modian. This is done with full knowledge and protection of
the King. Many see it as a necessary evil and do their best not to draw
the attention of any Draco-Cultists. Unknown to most, there are members
of other Draco-Cults, in service to some of the other dragons.

- Knowledge Check
  - 22 There are cultists at work near [Castle Heron](#castle-heron) that do the bidding of a **Silver Dragon** in the south

### University of Lutra

[Lutra](#lutra) is home to one of the only two major schools of higher learning in [the kingdom](#the-kingdom), the other being the [Gratz School](#grats) in [the capital](#blackstone).  The school has three major segments; **The Martial College** which trains many capable knights and officers, **The Arcanum** which is the only formal school for learning magic and **The Gabson College** which is a minor but famous culinary and animal husbandry school.

The school also boasts the largest singular library in the kingdom, **Kongalee Library**.

### Gratz

**The Gratz School** is a large college in [Blackstone](#blackstone) that produces squires, soldiers, officers and even knights.  The school was transformed after the entire faculty quit in protest forty years ago and new instructors were selected primarily from the royals houses and [the Draco Cults](#the-draco-cults).

### The Kimbree

The most fearsome orcish tribe in the south.  The Orcs from travel from all over to join banners with the Kimbree.  They are constantly pillaging and terrorizing the southlands.

- Knowledge Check

  - 13 **Warlord Zab Bata** leads _the Kimbree_
  - 18 Members of [the Draco-Cults](#the-draco-cults) can move freely amongst the Kimbree war camps.
  - 24 More than anything else, the Kimbree are after clean water, or magic that can rid their springs of a _strange disease_ that torments Orcish young.

### House Heron

One of the most powerful and largest noble houses in *The Kingdom*.
Known for their riches, the size of their territory and the size of
their family. The house boasts over a hundred lords and ladies.

### The Magi

The magi is a catch all term for the arcane casters of the kingdom. Magi
aren't a unified group even though they are often considered so by the
peoples of *The Kingdom*. Many Magi take on apprentices or sit on
councils but there isn't a singular rule or convention regarding their
ways.

### The Elves

While not technically a guild or faction, **The Elves** in the kingdom do constitute a group even if they do not act in one.

In their individual lives and personalities, elves vary widely but one singular fact puts real distance between them and the other races--As far as anyone else can tell, elves do not age and do not die.  If pressed, an elf may admit to a tavern full of listeners that he or she is in fact several hundred years old and even considers him or herself young!

This is usually hard for the other races to understand and often drives elves to live a more or less insular life.  It is hard for most elves to be overly charming and disarming considering how far they expect to outlive their comrades.

Many in the kingdom are suspicious of elves, perhaps even more so than they are of half-orcs.

### The Laplass Family

The Laplass family has been in control of the throne for almost a
century. Members of the Laplass family are simultaneously known for long
life and violent death. The eldest living member is *Count Putnam
Laplass* but *The Queen* herself is said to be not much younger.

## Myth and Minutiae

### Witchcraft

Magic of the wizarding sort is rare within *The Kingdom*. It is most
often found within the halls of on of the *Magi schools of magic*. Most
common folk find *polite* tricks of magic amusing and harmless but tend
do decide for themselves what is friendly magic and what is witchcraft.
*The Church* has no problem amplifying such suspicions of the dark
arts.

### Raz-Modian

The great old colossal red dragon that dominates the north eastern
*Druuthenholm Mountains*

### The Code

A code-of-conduct for all nobles and knights.  Most know it exists but very few know what's in it.  There are a few written copies in old book-seller shops.  It is usually a vague term to denote _chivalry_.

- Knowledge Check
  - 12 The code makes clear that a noble should never strike an unarmed foe, never strike in anger and never strike in greed
  - 14 The code states that all are **knights** by virtue of following the code itself
  - 16 The code says a knight shall never draw his sword as mere threat without intent
  - 20 According to the code, knights shall never marry until they give their arms and armor away
  - 24 The code says something about how power should be distributed in the kingdoms by high-council..

### The Prayers

The holy book that is kept by all true followers of *Sol*. Copies are
created, blessed and sold by *The Church* and updated periodically by a
process called *Illumination*. It is forbidden by law in *The Kingdom*
to possess an un-illuminated copy of The Prayers and they are destroyed
whenever found.

### Illumination

A perfect original of [*The Prayers*](#the-prayers) is kept in the *Jingwei Basilica*
Anything written into the original book there, is magically transfered
into all illuminated copies of the prayers.

### Gold Creep

Gold creep is a wheat-yellow fungus or lichen that spreads liberally in
some parts of [*The Kingdom*](#the-kingdom) usually in forests but there is a famous
patch just outside [*Bondwafer*](#bondwafer). It isn't clear what Gold Creep is but it
is somewhat edible and sweet, can be scraped into a powder and some say
it has healing powers.  Most consider it a blight on the land because of
how it covers everything and can choke out plants and passersby alike.
All pollen eating animals seem attracted to it and weeds flourish from
under it. [*Goodly Grue*](#goodly-grue), is the foremost expert on Gold Creep

### Entangled Items

Although magic items themselves are very rare; there is a strangely common attribute amongst those that do exist.  Many are _entangled_ with other items or have some strange relationship to a single or many others.  The most common expression of this anomaly is that of the _Entangled Pen_ which is in common use amongst in [the church](#The-Church).

### Holy Avatar

It is believed that [Sol](#sol-birth) will come to the material plane some time in this century to inhabit the spirit of a young child under the age of **26**.

### Wood Grail

The **Wood Grail** is a legendary artifact that is said to contain a small bit of [Mir's](#mir-life) mind.  If one drinks from the wood grail, they are given the answers to their deepest questions and an instruction as to how they should fulfill their destiny.
