To be given out at character creation by the discretion of the DM based on _player ability_ and party cohesion.  They are not associated to any pre-made character per se.

## The Dream Again

You suffer a recurring nightmare.  You find yourself on the rocky and muddy shores of a cold coast.  The air is misty and you are scared, trying to keep your composure as you hastily make your way to the waters edge.  It feels like you are leaving behind some crime you've committed or a meeting with a powerful lord who could snap his fingers and have you thrown into a cell.  Floating there is a long black row boat with a figure in it holding the oars.  You scramble to it and jump in.  The ferryman is old and disfigured.  In your trembling and freezing hand is a dirty silver coin.  Sometimes you speak with the ferryman and sometimes you just hand him the coin and he sets off across the river or lake.  The parts of the dream you remember don't seem that frightening but you always wake short of breath in a cold sweat.

## All Hail The Cook

You once had a chance meeting with a traveling caravan cook named **Sher-Shoe Zab**.  You took him to be some sort of strange looking halfling or perhaps a shaven dwarf.  Either way, while you sat at his makeshift buggy counter, he made for you what he called _Chirpee Dew Gumbo_.  It was the best stew you ever had.  It was the best food you had ever had.  You think it might have been the best food ever created.  You begged **Sher-Shoe** for the _secret_ recipe and he laughed, telling you the recipe was no secret and you were welcome to it.  The taste of the stew didn't come from it's preparation but rather the rare ingredients used.  Everything seemed fairly easy to come by except for two special things:

```Recipe
* A large fistful of dried fast-tack mushroom moss
* A pinch of fresh glass-globe berries
```

In your gear, you have `A large fistful of dried fast-tack mushroom moss`

If you can find `A pinch fresh glass-globe berries` you can brew tasty _Chirpee Dew Gumbo_, each serving of which has the effect of **potion of heal** while hot.

## Not-so-Much a Pet

You have a small _Crested Zebra Finch_ that has been following you around for almost a year.  Sometimes it disappears for days but it always turns up again.  You're not sure what it wants or why it follows you.  You've been able to feed it from your hand a few times before but it usually keeps its distance and just watches.

You should come up with a name for the bird.
