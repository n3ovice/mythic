<h2 id="the-dream-again"><a class="header-link" href="#the-dream-again"></a>The Dream Again</h2>
<p>You suffer a recurring nightmare. You find yourself on the rocky and
muddy shores of a cold coast. The air is misty and you are scared,
trying to keep your composure as you hastily make your way to the waters
edge. It feels like you are leaving behind some crime you’ve committed
or a meeting with a powerful lord who could snap his fingers and have
you thrown into a cell. Floating there is a long black row boat with a
figure in it holding the oars. You scramble to it and jump in. The
ferryman is old and disfigured. In your trembling and freezing hand is a
dirty silver coin. Sometimes you speak with the ferryman and sometimes
you just hand him the coin and he sets off across the river or lake. The
parts of the dream you remember don’t seem that frightening but you
always wake short of breath in a cold sweat.</p>

<h2 id="all-hail-the-cook"><a class="header-link" href="#all-hail-the-cook"></a>All Hail The Cook</h2>
<p>You once had a chance meeting with a traveling caravan cook named
<strong>Sher-Shoe Zab</strong>. You took him to be some sort of strange looking
halfling or perhaps a shaven dwarf. Either way, while you sat at his
makeshift buggy counter, he made for you what he called <em>Chirpee Dew
Gumbo</em>. It was the best stew you ever had. It was the best food you had
ever had. You think it might have been the best food ever created. You
begged <strong>Sher-Shoe</strong> for the <em>secret</em> recipe and he laughed, telling you
the recipe was no secret and you were welcome to it. The taste of the
stew didn’t come from it’s preparation but rather the rare ingredients
used. Everything seemed fairly easy to come by except for two special
things:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-comment">* A large fistful of dried fast-tack mushroom moss</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">* A pinch of fresh glass-globe berries</span></code></pre><p>In your gear, you have <code>A large fistful of dried fast-tack mushroom
moss</code></p>
<p>If you can find <code>A pinch fresh glass-globe berries</code> you can brew tasty
<em>Chirpee Dew Gumbo</em>, each serving of which has the effect of <strong>potion of
heal</strong> while hot.</p>
<h2 id="not-so-much-a-pet"><a class="header-link" href="#not-so-much-a-pet"></a>Not-so-Much a Pet</h2>
<p>You have a small <em>Crested Zebra Finch</em> that has been following you
around for almost a year. Sometimes it disappears for days but it always
turns up again. You’re not sure what it wants or why it follows you.
You’ve been able to feed it from your hand a few times before but it
usually keeps its distance and just watches.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="http://www.efinch.com/birdpix3/bbcrest.jpg" alt="Crested Zebra Finch"></p>
<p>You should come up with a name for the bird.</p>

and forgiveness but when they <em>have reason</em> they have little trouble
finding a passage or two in <em>The Prayers</em> to excuse violent torture.</p>
